                                   <p>Plan for the big event with professionally designed wedding invitation cards. Many customizable templates are available, making it easy to find the 
                                       ideal style for your special day. Invitations should go out at least eight weeks before the event, so order cards a few weeks before this date. 
                                       This gives enough time to address the envelopes and ensures they arrive with recipients so they can plan to attend. </p>

                                       <h3>Wedding Cake Boxes</h3>
                                       <p>We have hundreds 
                                           of products to beautifully package your smaller goodies, in a range of colours to suit your individual needs. Here at Samanal Card Center, we believe that a
                                        box is just a box without creative input. That's why we pride ourselves on creating cake packaging that looks great and will also keep your cake safe.

                                        Something we also take seriously here at Packqueen is the environment. We know that cake packaging serves one purpose; to protect your cake - it's 
                                        there to safely transport your cake from one place to another, or to display it nicely at an event. Once it's used, it'll be thrown away. That's why 
                                        we only stock biodegradable cake packaging. Rather than sitting in landfill for years to come, our packaging will gradually decompose into natural 
                                        materials.</p>
